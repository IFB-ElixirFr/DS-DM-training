### Learning Objectives:
Learners should be able to:
- understand FAIR Principles for (meta)data and its importance. They will have general knowledge of how to assess overall FAIRness of their day-to-day (meta)data and related processes and how to propose and implement necessary changes including rule/policy definition and dissemination. They will be also able to orient themselves in existing tools and incorporate these tools into their data management workflows.

- describe data management life-cycle and assign each of their activities into one of the life-cycle phases. They should know what are the key outcomes and how to avoid common mistakes made in each phase.
- plan their project data management and processing in concise and effective way using dedicated tools while following international and internal (institutional) standards.
- understand the necessity of reproducibility of data processing and analyses and its impact on scientific work. They should gain strong confidence in designing a reproducible data processing workflow and profit from it in their future scientific career.
- choose proper solution for archiving or publishing of their research data to adhere to FAIR data principles
