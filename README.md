# Best practices in research data management and stewardship

The course is made up of seven sessions covering:

 * Data management planning
 * Data protection in research, requirements and responsibilities originating from GDPR
 * Practicalities of data handling
 * Reproducible computational analyses
 * Exploratory analyses, reproducible manuscripts
 * FAIR data principles
 * Data publishing and archival
 
 
**Teaching Objectives:**

 * To remember the research data lifecycle, to reveal data management planning as a form of decision making. Listing key factors that shape data management decisions.
 * To learn about software tools that assist data management planning.
 * To learn how the GDPR affects research and to reveal researchers' responsibilities when working with human-subject data. 
 * To learn about the record keeping requirements of the GDPR, and the tools that can be used for record keeping during the course of research.
 * ...
 * ... 
 * To learn about FAIR data principles and their rationale, to reveal key indicators for FAIR'ness for a dataset.
 * ... 
 * ... 
 
**Learning Outcomes:**

 * Learners can list key decision areas that underlie data management.
 * Learners can use the Data Stewardship Wizard to record data management decisions for prospective projects.
 * Learners can list requirements for accountable use of human data in research
 * Learners can use the Data Information System to keep record of research projects and sensitive human-subject data. 
 * ...
 * ... 
 * Learners can tell whether or not their current practices on data handling results in FAIR data.
 * ...

# Materials to be explored before attending the course

 * Running example for course practicals ([PDF](resources/DM-DP_RunningExample.pdf)), and the paper by [GÃ©rard et.al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6380961/) which is the actual study that inspired our running example
